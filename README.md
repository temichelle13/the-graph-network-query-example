A set of example code to showcase how to query The Graph Network 


This repository contains a set of code that serves as an example of how to query the Graph network.

### Overview
The code in this repository demonstrates how to interact with the Graph network by performing queries. The Graph is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains, making it easier to access blockchain data without having to run a full node.

How It Works
The code included here showcases the process of querying the Graph network to retrieve specific data from a blockchain. It demonstrates how to construct and execute queries to obtain the desired information.

### Usage
To use this code as a reference for querying the Graph network, follow these steps:

1.) Clone the repository to your local machine.

2.) Review the code files to understand the query examples provided.

3.) Modify the queries according to your specific requirements.

4.) Execute the queries to interact with the Graph network and retrieve the data you need.
